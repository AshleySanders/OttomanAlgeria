Mourad, according to Grangaud was a freed slave of Corsican origin, a janissary who would have been considered a ""Turk"" in Algeria: ""esclave affranchi d'origine corse"" (Grangaud, v.2, 293). It appears from a note in Feraud, ""Epoque de l'établissement des Turcs à Constantine"" Revue Africaine(1866), 196 that Mourad succumbed in battle during the revolt. Tired of the violence and exhausted from an intense drought and famine, in 1647, the Constantinois wrote a letter to the Dey in Algiers, submitting to his rule and requesting a governor. Mourad's son, Ferhat, was chosen, and the Dey approved their request. (Vayssettes, 80-1)","For a long time, the Bu 'Akkaz had been defiant and disobedient, so when the Sheikh-al-Arab Muhammed ben Sakheri Bu 'Akkaz arrived at Mourad Bey's spring camp, Mourad asked the Dey of Algiers if he could make an example of them. The Dey acquiesced, and Mourad had the heads of the Sheikh and his entourage cut off and placed on the ramparts of Constantine. To avenge the death of his brother, Ahmed ben Sakheri led an enormous revolte.

This might mean that he was an Ottoman outsider. ""Dès que le calme fut rétabli, le bey, disposant de toutes ses troupes s’attaqua aux tribus du Sud. Avec la fraction la plus turbulente des Douaouda commandée par Oum-Hanni, veuve de Ahmed Ben Sekhri, il contracta une alliance en épousant sa fille. Il eut des lors en permanence à sa disposition une cavalerie nombreuse qu’il utilisa dans toutes se expéditions."" (Gaïd, 24).  It is also worth noting, though, that this bey shares the same name as Kheir ed-Dine Barbarossa, one of the founders of the Algerian Regency, and likely the son of a Sipahi (Turkish cavalryman) who served in Mytilene after Lesobos fell. (Roughton, 1) This also suggests that he may have been Ottoman or Kulughlu, but it is hard to know 150 years after Kheir-ed-Dine Barbarossa ruled the province. ","Given the note on the cited pages in Vayssettes & Mercier, I concluded that Kheir-ed-Dine Bey was most likely Algerian: ""Jusqu'alors, les beys avaient été choisi, autant que possible, dans les familles influentes du pays; mais à l'avenir, ce fonctionnaire sera souvent un homme de race turque, pris parmis les yoldach ou leurs compatriots."" (Mercier, 235; similar statement in Vayssettes, 88). However, this makes little sense, given that from at least 1622, the province had been governed by a member of the Ottoman Mourad Bey's family.  The reign of Kheir ed-Din Bey marks an important shift in Ottoman governing policy. According to Vayssette and Mercier, through his governance, beys had been selected from among the notable families in the region who were ethnically Arab. After his reign, beys were supposed to be chosen from the ranks of the janissaries or from among the Turkish families located in the Regency. (Vayssettes, 88) However, my data shows that this may not have been true. The Ottomans may have been merely caudifying in law practices that they had already implemented for the previous 50 years.","Married the daughter of Oum-Hanni, the daughter of Redjeb Bey. (Gaïd, 24)"
