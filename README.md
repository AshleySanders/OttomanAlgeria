## Data Sources

### European Travel Narratives & Consular Journals
One of the earliest European sources is the Spanish Benedictine Diego de Haëdo’s *Topografia e historia general de Argel*, based on his sojourn in Algiers between 1578 and 1581, and later published in 1612 in Spain. Following the French conquest, Haëdo’s work was translated into French and several annotated versions were published in the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Haëdo 1870). In addition to Haëdo’s narrative, French consuls provide some of the most richly detailed and informed European accounts from the Ottoman period. Jacques Philippe Laugier de Tassy served as Chancellor of the French Consulate in Algiers between 1717 and 1718 and published his *Histoire du royaume d’Alger* in 1725 (“Jacques Philippe Laugier de Tassy” n.d.; de Tassy 1725). Laurent d’Arvieux’s personal journal, recorded in the mid- to late seventeenth-century while Arvieux served as a consul throughout the Ottoman Empire, including Algiers, was posthumously published in 1735 as *Memoires du chevalier d’Arvieux* (Arvieux 1735).

Following the 1830 conquest of Algeria, France employed men fluent in Arabic to learn about, and report on, the socio-political history and present status of the regions in which they worked. Several of these men also published chronicles of the region’s history under Ottoman rule. Among them, Eugene Vayssettes (1826-1899) held various teaching appointments primarily in Constantine between 1847 and 1865, then served as a French-Arabic interpreter and translator for another decade before his retirement (“Eugène Vayssettes (1826-1899)” n.d.; Vayssettes 1867). Author of numerous works on Algeria published in French and Arabic, Vayssettes’ *Histoire de Constantine sous la domination turque*, is most relevant to this study.  The son of a French colon who settled in Algeria in 1854, Ernest Mercier (1840-1907) served as a military interpreter, the head of an “Arab Bureau,” and later became the mayor of Constantine. Fascinated by the history of his adopted land, he published twenty-seven books and translations of three Arabic works (Zeiller 1945; “Ernest Mercier (1840-1907)” n.d.; Mercier 1903). Similarly, Laurent-Charles Féraud (1829-1888) served as an interpreter for the Governor General of Algeria, Consul General of France in Tripoli (from 1844), Minister Plenipotentiary in Morocco (in 1884), and President of the Archaeological Society of Algeria. He was also a prolific author, publishing more than twenty works, during his years of service (“Laurent-Charles Féraud (1829-1888)” n.d.). Born in Algeria in 1916, the most contemporary chronicler, Mouloud M. Gaid, was a teacher, political and labor activist, as well as a local historian. He wrote six major works on the history of Algeria, specializing in the history of the Berbers, or Imazighen (“Mouloud Gaid (1916-?)” n.d.; Gaïd 1978). Their chronicles corroborate and correct some of the data on Constantine’s political history from Arabic source materials.  

### Arabic Sources

Born into a family of notable Algerian writers and administrators, Ṣāliḥ Ibn Muḥammad Al-ʿAntarī’s grandfather was a scribe for Sāliḥ Bey (r. 1771-1792), and his father was the scribe for Hadj Aḥmad Bey (r. 1826-1837), the last Bey of Ottoman Constantine. Al-ʿAntarī’s chronicle of the province’s beys provides fundamental information on their origins, kinship connections, length of tenure in office, and fate at the end of their terms. Unlike Al-ʿAntarī, little is known about another Algerian historian, other than his family lineage and birthplace (Constantine), which we can identify from his full name: Ahmed ben Omar ben Ahmad ben Mohammed ben El Attar El Mobarek El Qosantiny. He came to my attention through his translated history of Constantine, *Traduction du Kitab Tarikh Qosantina*, published in 1913, a part of which is reproduced in the journal *Revue africaine*, published in the same year (El Mobarek 1913; Ahmed ben Omar ben Ahmad ben Mohammed ben El Attar El Mobarek El Qosantiny and Dournon 1913). 

### Ottoman Records

Published in four volumes between 1890 and 1897, the *Sicill-i Osmani*, "The Ottoman National Biography" is the most detailed and inclusive collection of biographical data on Ottoman leaders. Nevertheless, despite of compiler Mehmed Süreyya's aims, it is far from comprehensive. Eminent men from the early period of the Ottoman Empire, particularly the fourteenth through the sixteenth centuries, receive scant attention. Notable Ottoman prosopographer, İ. Metin Kunt, remarks:

> mostly for the earlier periods, the biographical notes for each entry are usually no more than a few lines; the scanty information provided is also often wrong in one way or another. In view of the defective character of Sicill-i Osmani, for a sound and valid study it should be used only after it has been corrected and supplemented by information gleaned from other sources, such as chronicles and, whenever possible, archival documents (Kunt, 1983, p. xix).

Consequently, I am keeping data gleaned from the *Sicill-i Osmani* separate from the main data set. I will also compare and correct this data based on a review of the Ottoman sources that have survived from Algeria. These archival documents will also be used to augment the original data set on Constatine's governors, as well as the Constantinian social network data that will be uploaded to this repository. 

The Ottoman archival documents used in this study are copies of the originals, which are currently held in the National Archives of Algeria. These are the only Ottoman administrative records that remain following the destruction of a number of documents during the French conquest and colonization (1830-1962). Microfilm copies may also be found in Archives Nationales de France in Series MI: "Archives turques d'Algérie, XVIIIe-XIXe s." (Code: 228 Mi, 1-49). (For a history of these records, see Temimi, 1979.)
