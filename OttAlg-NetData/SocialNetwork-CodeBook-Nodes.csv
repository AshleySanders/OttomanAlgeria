Arabic Name ,C,Arabic names given in Salīh al-Anteri’s chronicle,Salīh al-Anteri was the son of a long line of scribes who worked for the Ottoman governors of Constantine and was therefore either a witness to the events he described or closer to the original sources of information than were the French historians.,"Al-ʿAntarī, Ṣāliḥ Ibn Muḥammad. Farīdah manīsah [sic] fī ḥāl dukhūl al-Turk balad Qusanṭīnah wa-istīlāʾihim ʻalā awṭānihimā, aw, Tāʾrīkh Qusanṭīnah. Edited by Yaḥyā Bū ʿAzīz. Algeria: Dīwān al-Maṭbūʿāt al-Jāmiʿiyyah, 1991."
Gender,D,Based on French and Algerian documents that denote individuals as being either male or female.,,
Ethnicity,E,"This information is based on identity markers that source authors used, such as ""turc d'origine"" (Turk by origin), ""kouloughli"" (kulughlu, or the son of an Ottoman official and local woman), or from the family lineage provided in the sources. In some cases, this information is inferred based on several sources and is marked as such in the notes section for the governor's case.","Those born in Algeria between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries were most likely to identify themselves by their tribal affiliation and/or the town in which they lived. Generally, the only people known as “Algerians” were those from the city of Algiers. To further complicate this picture, some of the men described as “Ottoman” in the sources were ethnic Turks, while others were “Turks by profession.” In his Topographie et histoire Générale d’Alger, Diego de Haëdo remarks that the “Turks by profession” were all “renegades,” or Christians “by blood and parentage,” who had become “Turks” by conscription into the janissaries. To account for this nuance, I added columns for place-of-origin and tribal affiliation, but for comparative purposes, I needed to keep the ethnicity codes simple. For this reason, I chose the following categories: “Ottoman” for ethnic Turks; “Algerian” for those born within the borders of the modern-day state of Algeria, and “Kulughlu” for sons of Ottoman men and Algerian women.",
